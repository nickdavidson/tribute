            <p>Shigeru Miyamoto, born November 16, 1952 in Sonobe, Japan.</p>
            <p>If you spent any time as a child (or adult) playing a Nintendo game, it's almost a certainty that you are aquainted with the work of Shigeru Miyamoto. Beloved by gamers and critics alike, Miyamoto is responsible for creating many of the most iconic video game characters and worlds that shaped our childhoods, and the industry as a whole.</p>
            <p>Miyamoto is most well known as the creator of eminent franchises such as <em>Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros.,</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, as well as having a hand in franchises such as <em>F-Zero, Star Fox,</em> and <em>Pikmin</em>. There are few in the industry today who haven't been influenced by Miyamoto's work.</p>
            <p>In a world where modern video game blockbusters tend to showcase cutting edge graphics, engrossing storylines, dialogue, and online gameplay, Miyamoto's design philosophy focuses on one thing: is the game fun? Forgoing, the use of focus groups, Nintendo often relied on Miyamoto's own experience in determining if a game was fun or not - "As long as I can enjoy it, other people can enjoy it too."</p>
            <p>It's this fun-first approach to development that gives Nintendo's game a certain magical charm that enhances the player's experience. Where some games do their best to provide a form of escapism for players, Miyamoto wants to bring the fun of video games into their lives.</p>
            <p>Make fun games that can be enjoyed by everybody. That is Miyamoto's goal, which he has achieved multiple times over - and that which has brought Nintendo huge success and popularity all over the world.</p>

            <h3 id="tribute-list-title">Miyamoto Facts!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One of Miyamoto's favorite hobbies is guessing the dimensions of real-world objects he encounters in his day-to-day life. He carries a pocket-sized tape measure to see how accurate he is! You can see him demonstrating this on The Tonight Show <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiUeuc7eOh0" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
                <li>Miyamoto's games are heavily inspired by the outdoor expeditions of his childhood. He recalls the his of wonder discovering lakes and caves in the Kyoto countryside. His goal is to recreate this sense of exploration and wonder in his games, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda.</em></li>
                <li>Nintendo will not allow him to ride a bike to work. They consider him to be too valuable to the company to risk the possibilty of being injured by passing motorists.</li>
